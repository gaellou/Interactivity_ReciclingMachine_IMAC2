The idea is a recycling machine with a survey connected interface. To participate, you have to flash the QR Code and just after you have to put a plastic bottle or can in the recycling machine corresponding to your answer. The machine detects it and validates your action on your phone. The poll is composed of several questions proposed randomly. Considering the quantity of bottles they put in. The more you put, the more you earn points to get a reward on the mobile app.
The survey questions can be proposed by the city institutions or other institutions or private companies (with city’s agreement). The questions are changed every day and generated randomly during the day, so people don’t have to answer the same question, a new question is generated every time the user puts a bottle in the machine.
